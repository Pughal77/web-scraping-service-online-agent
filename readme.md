For demo purposes, we are using crawlee straigh from the cloud.
For an isolated instance of crawlee (for security and privacy),
    - There is an github repo that is available (apify/crawlee) but we are unsure how to use it after building it. Probably adding another python script or js file (unsure how to import newly built modules or libraries)
    - Disabling telemetry is also needed (or gutting relavant telemetry, otlp, OpenTelemetry, and analytics, stub those functions)
